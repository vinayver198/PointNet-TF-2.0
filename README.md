# PointNet-TF-2.0
### This project is reimeplementation of [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) in tensorflow 2.0. The motivation behind this project is to understand the architecture and its validation on ModelNet[https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/] dataset . 

# Getting Started 
Clone the github repository and follow the steps below 
## Prerequisites
Here is a list of software will be required to build this model.
1. Python >= 3.0+
2. Tensorflow 2.0
3. Numpy
4. Scipy
5. Open3d (for visualization)

## Creating conda environment
I have included pointnet_env.yml which will allow you to create required environment for this model.

```
conda env create -f pointnet_env.yml
```
## Training the model
